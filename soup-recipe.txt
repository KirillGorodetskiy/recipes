Ingredients 
Serves: 4 
50g (2 oz) butter
1 clove garlic, chopped
1 small onion, chopped
3 large leeks, chopped
3 medium potatoes, peeled and diced
900ml (1 1/2 pints) chicken stock
small handful chopped fresh parsley
1 bouquet garni
Salt and freshly ground black pepper
1 vegetable stock cube

Method
Prep:15min  ›  Cook:40min  ›  Ready in:55min 
Melt the butter in a large saucepan on medium heat, and sauté garlic and onions for a few minutes stirring frequently.
Add remaining ingredients and bring to the boil. Simmer for 30 minutes. Remove the bouquet garni and purée soup with a hand blender. Add cornflour to thicken the soup if it is too thin. Serve with buttered bread.

Tip:
Since you are puréeing the soup, you can very roughly chop the leeks, onions and potatoes - don't waste your time getting them to be uniform in size!

Tip:
Make this soup vegan by using olive oil instead of butter and vegetable stock instead of chicken stock.
